## 🧭 Project Overview  
The **Toronto Bike-Sharing Analytics Tool** is a Python-based analytics dashboard that visualizes insights from the Toronto Bike Share Ridership dataset.  

The project follows the **Agile Scrum framework** over two sprints, emphasizing collaboration, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and continuous improvement.  

Our goal is to help users quickly explore key metrics such as **busiest stations, average trip duration, and peak usage hours**, using a clean, interactive dashboard built with **Streamlit**.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Apply **Agile principles** (Scrum, Sprints, User Stories, TDD, Refactoring).  
- Develop a **modular, reusable Python codebase**.  
- Build an **interactive data visualization dashboard**.  
- Demonstrate collaboration using **GitHub** and **Taiga**.  
- Measure productivity using **Agile metrics** (Burndown & Velocity charts).
